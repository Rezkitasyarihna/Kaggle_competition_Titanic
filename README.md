# Kaggle_competition_Titanic
My first contribution in Kaggle's competition using the 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster' dataset. 
The goal of this competition is to predict which Titanic's passangers who survived based on sex, ticket class, number of parent or child, and number of sibling or spouse.
The prediction result from train.csv used for predicting passangers in dataset test.csv
